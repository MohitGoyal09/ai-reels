transformers[sentencepiece] # For Hugging Face models (BART, SentenceTransformer's CLIP)
                           # sentencepiece is often needed for tokenizers
sentence-transformers    # For CLIP embeddings
                         # Also used in build_faiss_index
matplotlib               # For color utilities and visualization

# Object Detection
ultralytics             # For YOLOv8 object detection

# Computer Vision
opencv-python-headless   # For video/image processing (headless is usually fine for servers/Colab)
Pillow                   # PIL for image manipulation

# Vector Search
faiss-cpu                # For FAISS index (or faiss-gpu if you set that up)

# NLP Utilities
emoji                    # For cleaning emojis from text

# API Framework (If you were to build an API - not used in the scripts directly, but good to list if planned)
fastapi
# uvicorn[standard]
# python-multipart

# Optional, but good for development/debugging if you used them:
# jupyter # If you used Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
# scikit-learn # Might be used for evaluation metrics if you went that far
